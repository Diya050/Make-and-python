# Make-and-python

Make is called a build tool - it builds data files, plots, papers, programs or libraries. It can also update existing files if desired.

SetUp:
Checked if I already have Make installed by $ make -v. Make was already there. Make is a standard tool on most Linux systems and should already be available.

Python3 was already there.
Installed Numpy through $ sudo apt install python3-numpy successfully.
Installed Matplotlib using $ sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib successfully.
